# Iris Prediction
In my Iris Prediction project, I applied Python to develop a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal measurements. Using pandas and numpy, I loaded and analyzed the dataset (Iris.csv), checking for missing values and understanding feature distributions. Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn helped identify relationships between features and target classes.

I performed preprocessing, including feature scaling with StandardScaler, to prepare the data for modeling. For classification, I used algorithms from scikit-learn, starting with logistic regression and experimenting with decision trees and support vector machines. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and models were evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report to determine the best performer.

The final model was serialized using joblib into a .pkl file, enabling reuse without retraining. I also implemented a prediction function where users input measurements, and the model returns the predicted species.

This project demonstrated my ability to apply Python for data handling, visualization, model training, evaluation, and deployment. It strengthened my skills in problem-solving, working with machine learning libraries, and completing an end-to-end predictive analytics workflow.
